# AI-Enhanced Selenium Automation Framework

This project demonstrates the integration of open-source AI capabilities into a Selenium-based test automation
framework, combining the power of web automation with computer vision and image analysis.

## Key Features

1. **Selenium WebDriver Integration**: Utilizes Selenium for web browser automation.
2. **TestNG Support**: Enables parallel and non-parallel test execution using TestNG XML.
3. **Maven Project Structure**: Ensures easy dependency management and build processes.
4. **Extent Reports Integration**: Provides detailed and visually appealing test execution reports.
5. **OpenCV Integration**: Incorporates computer vision capabilities for enhanced UI testing.
6. **SOLID Principles**: Adheres to SOLID design principles for maintainable and extensible code.
7. **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements the Page Object Model design pattern for better test maintenance.
8. **Thread-Safe WebDriver**: Custom implementation for parallel test execution.
9. **Adaptive Wait Mechanism**: Intelligent waiting strategy to handle dynamic web elements.
10. **Extensive Logging**: Utilizes Log4j for comprehensive logging throughout the framework.

## AI Features

- **Image Recognition**: Utilizes OpenCV to perform image-based assertions and verifications.
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Compares screenshots to detect unexpected UI changes.
- **OCR Capabilities**: Extracts text from images for advanced validations.
